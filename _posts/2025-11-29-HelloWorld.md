title: "Kicking off my data and AI portfolio"
date: 2025-11-29
---

Today I published the first version of this site using GitHub Pages. It is still very simple, but it is an important step for me. I want a public space that shows what I am building in data, analytics and AI, instead of keeping everything hidden on my laptop.

## Who I am

I am Carlo, a people analytics specialist and postgraduate data science student from Cape Town. Most of my day is spent working with data, trying to turn messy tables into decisions that actually help people and organisations.

I enjoy thinking in systems. I like understanding how data flows from operational systems into reports, and how those reports influence decisions.

## Why I am building this site

There are three main reasons.

1. **Accountability**  
   If I say in public that I am working on a project, I am more likely to finish it. This site will be a log of what I am learning and shipping.

2. **A living portfolio**  
   Instead of a static CV, I want a portfolio that shows real code, real dashboards and real thinking. Over time I want this to reflect how my skills evolve, from basic analytics into more advanced AI and engineering work.

3. **Sharing what I wish I had earlier**  
   I did not grow up surrounded by people in tech or data. A lot of what I know comes from trial and error. I want to document some of that journey so that someone else can move faster than I did.

## What I plan to share

Over the next few months I want to publish short posts on:

- Experiments with AI agents and workforce trend research  
- My internal attrition prediction app and how I am rebuilding parts of it for a public portfolio  
- Notes from books and courses that influenced how I think about decision making and data  
- Small technical write ups on Python, SQL and BI tools that I use every day  

These posts do not need to be perfect. The goal is to be honest, clear and useful.

## How this site was made

This site is built with GitHub Pages and Jekyll. The process was straightforward:

1. Create a repository on GitHub  
2. Enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings  
3. Use the `my-pages` branch that the GitHub Pages course sets up  
4. Add a simple home page and this first blog post  

The tooling will improve over time.

## What is next

Next I want to:

- Design a cleaner landing page that explains who I am and what I do  
- Add a projects section with links to live demos and GitHub repositories  
- Start writing short, focused posts instead of waiting for “perfect” long essays  

If you are reading this in the future, I hope the site looks very different by then in a good way. For now, this first post is just a marker that the journey has officially started.
