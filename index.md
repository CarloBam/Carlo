# Welcome

I am Carlo, a people analytics specialist and postgraduate data science student from Cape Town. I work with Python, SQL and BI tools to turn data into clear stories and practical decisions.

## What you will find here

* Small experiments with AI and analytics  
* Write ups of projects I am building for university  
* Notes from books and courses that shape how I think about data and decision making  

## Current focus

1. Building an AI trend researcher to track workforce and generational trends  
2. Recreating my internal attrition prediction app in a portfolio friendly way  
3. Learning modern data engineering and cloud tools  

Check back soon as I start publishing project pages and interactive demos.
